# MATB34
MATB34 Linear Analysis, 7.5 credits, is an alternatively compulsory course for a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics. The course is given in English, at half study pace, in the first half of each semester. The course can be taken as as stand-alone course.

Course Content
The overarching goal of the course is that the student develop an understanding of fundamental concepts, results, and methods in Fourier analysis, and the ability to applythese to describe, analyze, and solve relevant problems related to linear analysis. The course aims to develop the students’ ability to communicate mathematics orally and in writing and to read mathematical texts. It also aims to prepare the student for further studies in mathematics, science, and technology.

The course treats:

Basic properties of Fourier series of functions in one variable. Exponential form and trigonometric form. Riemann-Lebesgue lemma. Elementary conditions for pointwise and uniform convergence. Gibbs phenomenon.
Basic properties of convolutions of periodic functions in one variable. Interaction with Fourier series. Convolution kernels and their applications in summing Fourier series. Fejér’s theorem and Weierstrass approximation theorem.
Linear spaces and examples of linear operators. Vector norm, inner product, and Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Hilbert space, minimum distance to closed convex sets, projection theorem. Orthonormal systems, Bessel’s inequality, and Parseval’s identity. Completeness of the Fourier system.
Basic properties of Fourier transforms of functions in one variable. Interaction with translation, modulation, scaling, differentiation and convolution. Laplace transforms. Elementary conditions for pointwise convergence of the inverse Fourier transform. Some information on Schwartz functions and Plancherel’s identity.
Applications towards classical partial differential equations such as the heat equation, wave equation, and Dirichlet problem in simple domains. Method of separation of variables.
During the course, notation for Lebesgue spaces naturally occurs. Properties of these can be briefly discussed but are not included in the course content that is part of the examination. For a rigorous presentation, refer to courses in Integration Theory.

Teaching
The teaching consists of lectures and seminars. The seminars are based on selected exercises and require active student participation, including preparation. During the course, one of the exercises must be presented in writing. The written presentation  must first be peer-reviewed and then, after possible correction, approved by the teacher.

Your lecturer is Evgeniy Lokharu and seminar teacher is Alex Bergman.
